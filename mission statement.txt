The mission of the Lost and Found Web Application is to provide a simple, accessible, and community-focused platform that helps individuals report, locate, and recover lost items efficiently. 
The application is designed to reduce the time and frustration involved in reconnecting people with their belongings by centralizing lost and found information in a single, easy-to-use system.

This project prioritizes usability, clarity, and inclusivity. By allowing users to post lost or found items with descriptions and images, the platform encourages collaboration and accountability within the community. 
The system is intended to be approachable for users of all technical backgrounds and to function reliably in a real-world campus or local environment.

In the long term, this project aims to serve as a foundation for future enhancements such as improved search and filtering, user authentication, and expanded deployment beyond a single community. 
As an open-source project, it also seeks to promote learning, transparency, and collaboration by providing readable code and clear documentation for contributors and students alike
