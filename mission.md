# Mission Statement

## Our Mission

Campus Lost & Found is dedicated to reducing the financial burden and frustration students experience when losing personal belongings on campus. We believe that recovering lost items should be simple, accessible, and free for all educational institutions.

## Our Vision

We envision a world where every university has access to a centralized, digital lost and found system that:
- **Empowers students** to quickly post and recover lost items with visual identification
- **Reduces waste** by decreasing unnecessary replacement purchases
- **Builds community** through a platform that helps students help each other
- **Remains accessible** through open source development and free deployment options

## Our Values

**Open Source First**: We believe essential campus services should be freely available to all institutions, regardless of budget. Our MIT license ensures anyone can use, modify, and improve this platform.

**Privacy & Security**: We protect user data and implement authorization systems that prevent abuse while maintaining ease of use.

**Simplicity**: We prioritize intuitive design that requires no training. Anyone should be able to post or find an item in under a minute.

**Community-Driven**: We welcome contributions from developers, designers, and users worldwide to continuously improve the platform for all campuses.

## Our Commitment

We commit to:
- Maintaining clear, comprehensive documentation for all contributors
- Responding to issues and pull requests in a timely manner
- Following best practices in web security and data protection
- Supporting universities in deploying and customizing the platform
- Building features that serve the real needs of campus communities
